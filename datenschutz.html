    <h2>3. General information and mandatory information</h2>
    <p>Data protection
    
    The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your
    personal data confidential and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations, and
    this privacy policy.
    
    When you use this website, various personal data are collected.
    Personal data are data that can be used to identify you personally. The present
    Privacy Policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how
    and for what purpose.
    
    We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) may have
    security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not
    possible.
    
    Note on the responsible entity
    
    The responsible party for data processing on this website is:
    
    Leon Sodja
    Sophienterrasse 14
    20149 Hamburg
    
    Phone: -
    E-mail: tradecoin.business@gmail.com
    
    The responsible body is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means
    of the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.). decides.
    <br>
    Storage duration
    Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will
    remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request
    for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other
    legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial
    law); in the latter case, the data will be deleted once these reasons no longer apply.
    General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website
    If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) a
    DSGVO or Art. 9 (2) a DSGVO, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO.
    In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is
    also based on Art. 49 (1) a DSGVO. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to
    information in your terminal device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally
    carried out on the basis of Section 25 (1) TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is
    required for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we
    process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO. Furthermore, if your data is required for the
    fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO. Furthermore, the
    data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f
    DSGVO. Information about the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following
    paragraphs of this privacy policy.
    Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries
    Among other things, we use tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not
    secure under data protection law. If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to
    these third countries and processed there. We would like to point out that no level of data protection
    comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these countries.
    For example, U.S. companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as the
    data subject being able to take legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that U.S. authorities
    (e.g. intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on U.S. servers for
    monitoring purposes. We have drawn attention to this
    6 / 10
    Processing activities have no influence.
    Revocation of your consent to data processing
    Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent
    you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation
    remains unaffected by the revocation.
    Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct marketing (Art. 21 DSGVO)
    IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F DSGVO,
    YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME
    FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING
    BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED
    CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR
    PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE
    PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING
    SERVES THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION
    UNDER ARTICLE 21 (1) DSGVO).
    IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE
    THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU
    FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS
    CONNECTED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL
    SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION
    PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 (2) DSGVO).
    Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority
    In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of appeal to a supervisory
    authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of
    the alleged breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
    Right to data portability
    You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a
    contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the
    direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.
    Information, deletion and correction
    Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information
    about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if
    necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions
    on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.
    Right to restriction of processing
    7 / 10
    You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose,
    you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
    If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For
    the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
    personal data.
    If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you may request the
    restriction of data processing instead of erasure.
    If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or enforce legal claims,
    you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
    If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your and our interests
    must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
    right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
    If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may - apart from being stored - only
    be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the
    protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of
    the European Union or a Member State.

If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your data from the inquiry form, including the contact data
you provided there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up
questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.

performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other
