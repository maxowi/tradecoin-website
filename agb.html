    the time of the order.

    (3) The presentation of the goods in our Internet store does not represent a legally binding contract offer on our part,
    but is only a non-binding invitation to the consumer to order goods. By ordering the desired goods, the consumer makes a
    binding offer to conclude a purchase contract.
    
    The acceptance of the offer is made in writing or in text form or by sending the ordered goods within one week. After
    the fruitless expiry of this period, the offer shall be deemed to have been rejected.
    
    (4) Upon receipt of an order in our Internet store, the following provisions shall apply: The consumer makes a binding

    6) Checking again or correcting the respective entered data.
    7) Binding sending of the order by clicking the button "order with costs" or "buy".
    
    Before the binding submission of the order, the consumer can, after checking his details, return to the Internet page on
    which the customer's details are recorded and correct input errors or cancel the order process by closing the Internet
    browser by pressing the "Back" button contained in the Internet browser used by him. We confirm the receipt of the order
    immediately by an automatically generated e-mail (confirmation of receipt). This does not constitute an acceptance of
    the offer. The acceptance of the offer is made in writing, in text form or by sending the ordered goods within one week.
    
    (5) Storage of the contract text for orders via our Internet store : We store the contract text and send you the order
    data and our terms and conditions by e-mail. You can also view the terms and conditions at any time at

    Consequences of revocation

    (with the exception of additional costs resulting from the fact that you have chosen a type of delivery other than the
    most favorable standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and no later than within fourteen days from the day
    on which we received the notification of your revocation of this contract. For this repayment, we will use the same
    means of payment that you used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with you; in no case will
    you be charged any fees because of this repayment.
    
    If you have requested that the services begin during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us a reasonable amount
    corresponding to the proportion of the services already provided up to the point in time at which you notify us of the
    exercise of the right of withdrawal with regard to this contract compared to the total scope of the services provided
    for in the contract.
